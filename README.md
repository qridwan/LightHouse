# Main Features:


- In the Home Page thereâ€™s a number of books displayed which is loaded from the mongoDB database.
- I deployed login authentication in this website. An unknown user only have access to the home page.
-Logged in user have access to go for ORDER, and also can perform to play an ADMIN-role where he/she can manage the product such as adding new book, deleting books from the database.
- SO it is compolsury to sign(google signin) in for the user to enjoy the whole funtionality of this application.
